# Project-1
Working Title: Musicify
Group Members:
   Thomas Cox, William Lukas, Abhishu Mukherjee, Joshua Vasquez
Description:
   On our website, the user will enter a keyword that will dynamically generate a Spotify playlist based on music in relation to   their keyword. Specifically, the keyword will be sent to the TasteDive API, which will generate the suggested artists.Those suggested artists will be sent to the Spotify API, where they will be formatted into a playlist. We will take the suggestions from TasteDive and specify how the songs will be selected in Spotify. The playlist will be embedded on the page upon generation so that the user can stay on our page to hear the new collection of songs.
